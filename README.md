# ðŸš€ About This Project
This is not just another calculator. This project was built as part of my journey to master Java fundamentals, explore console-based input/output, and strengthen my understanding of methods, loops, and modular programming.

Itâ€™s designed to show how a small program can elegantly combine logic, error handling, and user interaction.

# I built this project to challenge myself:

Can I make a calculator that doesnâ€™t crash even if a user divides by zero?
Can I structure the code so each operation has its own clear method?
Can I keep the user experience simple but robust?
The result is a clean, menu-driven console calculator that keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

# ðŸŒŸ Features & Highlights
Modular Methods: Each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is encapsulated in its own method for clarity and reusability.
Dynamic User Input: Uses Scanner to take user inputs at runtime.
Error Handling: Division by zero is caught gracefully with a user-friendly message.
Loop-Driven Menu: The calculator allows continuous operations until the user decides to quit.
Human-Centric Design: Designed for real usersâ€”no crashes, just smooth calculations.
# ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of:

Java Syntax & Methods: Writing clean, readable, and reusable code
Conditional Logic & Loops: Building interactive programs that respond to user input
Error Handling: Predicting and handling runtime errors like divide-by-zero
Practical Programming Mindset: Writing code that is easy to maintain and extend
